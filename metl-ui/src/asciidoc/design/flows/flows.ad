=== Flows

Each integration is written as a flow.  A flow defines the input to be read, the processing rules to be applied, and the output to be written.  Flows are a graphical
set of instructions for how data is integrated from a source system to a target system.  

Flows consist of a set of components (readers, processors or writers) connected together to form the flow.

The following table shows a list of available components.
